A full-stack web application for scheduling appointments between doctors and patients. Built with a modern tech stackâ€”Node.js for backend services and a frontend framework like Reactâ€”the platform features secure login, role-based access control, and calendar syncing via the Google Calendar API. The system includes easy-to-use interfaces for users to register, book appointments, and manage schedules. While visual design is kept simple, the app emphasizes clean architecture, secure handling of data, and scalable features like notifications and doctor search.
